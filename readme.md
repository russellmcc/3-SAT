# 3-sat, the ultimate puzzle!

3-sat is an NP-hard puzzle.

It's probably not very fun.

## How to play

The screen is divided into several triplets of letters, called "clauses".  Some letters are black, some letters are red.  The goal is to click on one letter in each clause.  The only trick is that for a given letter, you can't select both black and red copies of that letter.  Good luck!
